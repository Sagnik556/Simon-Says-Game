🎮 Simon Says Game

A simple and interactive Simon Says Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project recreates the classic memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors.

📌 Project Overview

The Simon Says Game is a memory challenge game where:

The system generates a random color sequence.

The player must repeat the sequence in the correct order.

Each correct round increases the difficulty by adding a new color.

The game ends when the player selects the wrong sequence.

This project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, animations, and game logic using pure JavaScript.
